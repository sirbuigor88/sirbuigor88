I am a passionate and driven individual who is interested in programming. I have recently completed a course on Java Spring Framework 5 and I am now seeking an opportunity to join a company where I can continue to learn and develop my skills as part of a team. I am looking for a mentor who can guide me and help me grow as a programmer while also making valuable contributions to the company.
